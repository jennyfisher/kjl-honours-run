This directory contains input files for the standard simulation as of
the GEOS-Chem version 9-01-03.

This set of input files was used for the 1-month benchmark.

The restart file is to be used with Linoz since the Ox tracer comes from a
tagged Ox simulation spinned-up with Linoz.

NOTE: The restart file provided with this run directory has not been properly
spun up for the updated linearized stratospheric chemistry scheme implemented
into GEOS-Chem v9-01-03o.

  The easiest option would be to do a multi-year simulation from constant
  initial conditions. I generated my well-spun up file by starting with every
  tracer set to 1ppt everywhere using
 
    make_restart,outm='GEOS5_47L',outr=4,outf='restart.2004010100',
                 tau0=nymd2tau(20040101L,0L),tr=indgen(53)+1,datavalue=1e-12

  The troposphere will re-equilibriate from 1ppt to actual concentrations
  fairly quickly, and then you can tell when stratosphere-troposphere
  equilibrium has become reasonable by check!ing the new online strat-trop
  exchange diagnostic that outputs to the log file. When you see the fluxes
  stabilize (e.g., an additional year only changes them by about 1%), you'll
  know it has reached equilibrium. CO and Ox in March are good proxies for STE.

The existing restart file will be replaced once a properly spun-up restart file
becomes available.
